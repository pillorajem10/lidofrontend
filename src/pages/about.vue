      <h1>HOME OF CHINESE PUGON-ROASTED ASADO</h1>
      <p>We take you back to the year 1936 when calesas clonked their way down the bustling streets and esquinitas of Binondo. On one of the narrow alleys stood a modest eatery called Panciteria Lido, owned by a Cantonese chef, known as Mr. Lido.</p>
